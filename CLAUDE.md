# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

# Project conventions

- Apps: `api` (NestJS 12 + Prisma 7), `public` (Angular 22 SSR, no login), `admin`, `customer` (Angular 22). See README.md.
- Use Node 24 (`.nvmrc`). Angular 22 refuses Node < 22.22.3.
- Backend: follow the `nestjs` skill (v12 APIs). Validate input with Zod schemas from `@all-in-one/shared/schemas` via `@Body({ schema })`.
- Frontend: follow `angular-developer` and `spartan` skills. Signals, `httpResource`, Signal Forms, spartan Helm components from `@spartan-ng/helm/*`; add components with `pnpm nx g @spartan-ng/cli:ui --name=<name>`.
- Shared schemas use `import * as z from 'zod/mini'` (named `{ z }` imports defeat tree-shaking in the browser).
- Database: edit `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`, then `pnpm nx run api:prisma-migrate --name=<change>`. Never edit applied migrations.
- The api reads `API_PORT`, not `PORT`: Nx loads the root `.env` into every task, and `PORT` would leak into the Angular dev servers.
- Tags: `scope:api`, `scope:web`, `scope:shared`; `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` blocks api <-> web imports.
- Before pushing: `pnpm nx run-many -t lint test build typecheck`.
